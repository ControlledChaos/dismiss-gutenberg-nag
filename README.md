# Gutenberg Nag
Dismiss, <strong>Gutenberg nag</strong>, dashboard widget, when is activated, or automatically, when put on mu-plugins directory.
* <strong>Tips</strong>: a neat trick is to <strong>put</strong> this single file <strong>gutenberg-nag.php</strong> (not its parent directory) in the <strong>/wp-content/mu-plugins/</strong> directory (create it if not exists) so you won't even have to enable it, and will be loaded by default, also, since first step of installation!
