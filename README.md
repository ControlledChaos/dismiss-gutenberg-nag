# Dismiss Gutenberg Nag
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/luciano-croce/dismiss-gutenberg-nag.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/luciano-croce/dismiss-gutenberg-nag)

Dismiss "<strong>try Gutenberg</strong>" nag, dashboard widget, when is activated, or when put on mu-plugins directory.
* <strong>Tips</strong>: a neat trick is to <strong>put</strong> this single file <strong>dismiss-gutenberg-nag.php</strong> (not its parent directory) in the <strong>/wp-content/mu-plugins/</strong> directory (create it if not exists) so you won't even have to enable it, and will be loaded by default, also, since first step of installation!
* <strong>To date</strong>, try Gutenberg nag, preliminarily introduced in WP [4.9-beta3](https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-9-beta-3/) was already respectively removed in WP 4.9-beta4, in WP 4.9-RC1, and in WP 4.9.0, but <strong>is expected to land in core when WP 4.9.1 is released</strong>, in late 2017/early 2018 according with this related ticket on [Core](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316).
