# Gutenberg Nag
Dismiss, <strong>Gutenberg nag</strong>, dashboard widget, when is activated, or automatically, when put on mu-plugins directory.
* Tips: a neat trick is to put this single file gutenberg-nag.php (not its parent directory) in the /wp-content/mu-plugins/ directory (create it if not exists) so you won't even have to enable it, and will be loaded by default, also, since first step of installation!
