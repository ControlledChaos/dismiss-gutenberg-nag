auto dismiss try gutenberg nag dashboard widget when is activated or automatically when put on mu-plugins directory

== Description ==

Auto Dismiss "<strong>try Gutenberg</strong>" nag, dashboard widget, when is activated, or automatically, when put on mu-plugins directory.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/luciano-croce/dismiss-gutenberg-nag.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/luciano-croce/dismiss-gutenberg-nag)

Development for this plugin takes place at [GitHub](https://github.com/luciano-croce/dismiss-gutenberg-nag/) official page.

= Tips =

A neat trick is to put this single file dismiss-gutenberg-nag.php (not its parent directory) in the /wp-content/mu-plugins/ directory (create it if not exists) so you won't even have to enable it, and will be loaded by default, also, since first step of installation!
